DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n     Distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n     i) changes to the Program, and\n     ii) additions to the Program;\n  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n  \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n  are not Modified Works.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\nor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\nform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\neditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\n\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\nresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\ncontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\nin Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\nWorks shall not include works that contain only declarations,\ninterfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\nin each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\nor Modified Works thereof.\n\n\"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\nin any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\n\"Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making\nmodifications, including but not limited to software source code,\ndocumentation source, and configuration files.\n\n\"Secondary License\" means either the GNU General Public License,\nVersion 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\nexceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\nContributor.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n  look for such a notice.\n\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\nClass Path Exception\n\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\na combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of\nthe GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\nand to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\nchoice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\nthe terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent\nmodule is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If\nyou modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\nthe library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do\nso, delete this exception statement from your version.\n"

DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n     Distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n     i) changes to the Program, and\n     ii) additions to the Program;\n  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n  \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n  are not Modified Works.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\nor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\nform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\neditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\n\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\nresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\ncontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\nin Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program.

GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\nClass Path Exception\n\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\na combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of\nthe GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\nand to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\nchoice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\nthe terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent\nmodule is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If\nyou modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\nthe library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do\nso, delete this exception statement from your version.\n"

Your code is not affected. | The base GPL is viral, but the Classpath Exception **neutralizes** this effect for linking. |\n| **Patent Rights** | Provides an **explicit** grant of patent rights from contributors. | Provides an **implicit** grant of patent rights. |\n\n---\n\n### Detailed Breakdown\n\n#### 1. Copyleft and the \"Viral\" Effect\n\nThis is the most significant difference.\n\n*   **EPL-2.0 (Weak Copyleft):** The EPL is considered a \"weak copyleft\" or a \"file-based\" copyleft license. This means that the license requirements are contained within the files that are licensed under the EPL.\n    *   If you take a file licensed under EPL-2.0 and modify it, you must make your modifications to that file available under the EPL-2.0.\n    *   However, you can write your own separate code in new files, link it to the EPL library, and license your own code however you want (e.g., as a proprietary commercial product). Your own code is not \"infected\" by the EPL.\n\n*   **GPL 2.0 with Classpath Exception (Strong Copyleft with an Exception):** The standard GPL 2.0 is a \"strong copyleft\" license, often described as \"viral.\" Normally, any software that links to a GPL library must itself be licensed under the GPL. The **Classpath Exception** is a special clause added to negate this specific behavior.\n    *   **Without the exception**, if you linked your proprietary application to a GPL library, your entire application would legally become a \"derivative work\" and you would be required to release your entire source code under the GPL.\n    *   **With the exception**, you are explicitly given permission to link your own \"independent modules\" (your application) with the library and distribute the combined work under your own terms. The viral nature of the GPL is intentionally turned off for the act of linking.\n\n#### 2. Scope of Required Source Code Sharing\n\n*   **EPL-2.0:** You only need to share the source code for the EPL-licensed files that you have modified. You do not need to share the source for your own proprietary code that uses the library.\n*   **GPL 2.0 with Classpath Exception:** If you modify the library itself, you are required to distribute your modifications to the library under the GPL. The exception allows you to keep your own code private, but it does not change the rules for modifying the library itself.\n\n#### 3. Patent Grants\n\n*   **EPL-2.0:** Contains a clear, **explicit** patent license grant. Any contributor to the code grants users a license to any patents they hold that would be infringed upon by using their contribution. This provides strong protection against patent lawsuits from contributors.\n*   **GPL 2.0:** Contains an **implicit** patent grant. While less explicit than the EPL's, it is generally understood that by contributing code to a GPL project, you are granting the necessary patent rights to use that code.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFor the end-user or a developer simply using these libraries in a larger project, the **practical outcome is very similar**: Both licenses allow you to use the library in a larger, closed-source, commercial application without forcing you to release your own source code.\n\nThe core difference lies in their philosophy and legal mechanics:\n*   The **EPL** was designed from the ground up to be business-friendly and allow for easy integration into commercial products.\n*   The **GPL with Classpath Exception** is an adaptation of a very strict license (GPL) to make it usable for foundational libraries (like in the Java ecosystem) where forcing every application to be GPL would be impractical and harm adoption."

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest\nto attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\nconvey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\nthe \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the\n    GNU General Public License for more details.\n\n    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along\n    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,\n    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.\n\nAlso add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.\n\nIf the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this\nwhen it starts in an interactive mode:\n\n    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author\n    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.\n    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it\n    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.\n\nThe hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate\nparts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:\n\n  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program\n  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.\n\n  signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989\n  Ty Coon, President of Vice\n\nThis General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into\nproprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may\nconsider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the\nlibrary.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General\nPublic License instead of this License.\n\nClass Path Exception\n\nLinking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making\na combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms and conditions of\nthe GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.\n\nAs a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you\npermission to link this library with independent modules to produce an\nexecutable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,\nand to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your\nchoice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,\nthe terms and conditions of the license of that module. An independent\nmodule is a module which is not derived from or based on this library. If\nyou modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of\nthe library, but you are not obligated to do so. If you do not wish to do\nso, delete this exception statement from your version.\n"

ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION\n    OF THE PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n1. DEFINITIONS\n\n\"Contribution\" means:\n\n  a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content\n     Distributed under this Agreement, and\n\n  b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:\n     i) changes to the Program, and\n     ii) additions to the Program;\n  where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from\n  and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution\n  \"originates\" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by\n  such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.\n  Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that\n  are not Modified Works.\n\n\"Contributor\" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.\n\n\"Licensed Patents\" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which\nare necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone\nor when combined with the Program.\n\n\"Program\" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this\nAgreement.\n\n\"Recipient\" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement\nor any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.\n\n\"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other\nform, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the\neditorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\nrepresent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.\n\n\"Modified Works\" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that\nresults from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the\ncontents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file\nin Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified\nWorks shall not include works that contain only declarations,\ninterfaces, types, classes, structures, or files of the Program solely\nin each case in order to link to, bind by name, or subclass the Program\nor Modified Works thereof.\n\n\"Distribute\" means the acts of a) distributing or b) making available\nin any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.\n\n\"Source Code\" means the form of a Program preferred for making\nmodifications, including but not limited to software source code,\ndocumentation source, and configuration files.\n\n\"Secondary License\" means either the GNU General Public License,\nVersion 2.0, or any later versions of that license, including any\nexceptions or additional permissions as identified by the initial\nContributor.\n\n2. GRANT OF RIGHTS\n\n  a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright\n  license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,\n  publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such\n  Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.\n\n  b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby\n  grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent\n  license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,\n  import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,\n  if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall\n  apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at\n  the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition\n  of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the\n  Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other\n  combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is\n  licensed hereunder.\n\n  c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the\n  licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are\n  provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the\n  patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.\n  Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims\n  brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual\n  property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the\n  rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby\n  assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual\n  property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party\n  patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the\n  Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license\n  before distributing the Program.\n\n  d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has\n  sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant\n  the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.\n\n  e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no\n  Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than\n  those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's\n  receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License\n  (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).\n\n3. REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n  look for such a notice.\n\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.\n"

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is safest\n  to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively\n  convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least\n  the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.\n\n    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>\n    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands you use may\nbe called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be\nmouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.\n\nYou should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your\nschool, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the program, if\nnecessary.

By contrast, the GNU General Public\nLicense is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\nsoftware--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\nGeneral Public License applies to most of the Free Software\nFoundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\nusing it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\nthe GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\nyour programs, too.\n\n  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\nprice.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\nhave the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\nthis service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\nif you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\nin new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n\n  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\nanyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\nThese restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\ndistribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n\n  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\ngratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\nyou have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\nsource code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\nrights.\n\n  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\ndistribute and/or modify the software.\n\n  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\nthat everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\nsoftware.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\nwant its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\nthat any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\nauthors' reputations.\n\n  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\npatents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\nprogram will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\nprogram proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\npatent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n\n  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\nmodification follow.\n\n                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n\n  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\na notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\nunder the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\nrefers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\nmeans either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\nthat is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\neither verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\nlanguage.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\nthe term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n\nActivities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\ncovered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\nrunning the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\nis covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\nProgram (independent of having been made by running the Program).\nWhether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n\n  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\nsource code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\nconspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\ncopyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\nnotices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\nand give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\nalong with the Program.\n\nYou may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\nyou may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n\n  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\nof it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\ndistribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\nabove, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:\n\n    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices\n    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.\n\n    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in\n    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any\n    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third\n    parties under the terms of this License.\n\n    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively\n    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such\n    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an\n    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a\n    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide\n    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under\n    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this\n    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but\n    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on\n    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)\n\nThese requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If\nidentifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,\nand can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in\nthemselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those\nsections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you\ndistribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based\non the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of\nthis License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the\nentire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.\n\nThus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest\nyour rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to\nexercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or\ncollective works based on the Program.\n\nIn addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program\nwith the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of\na storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under\nthe scope of this License.\n\n  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,\nunder Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of\nSections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:\n\n    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable\n    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections\n    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three\n    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your\n    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete\n    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be\n    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium\n    customarily used for software interchange; or,\n\n    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer\n    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is\n    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you\n    received the program in object code or executable form with such\n    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)\n\nThe source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for\nmaking modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source\ncode means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any\nassociated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to\ncontrol compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a\nspecial exception, the source code distributed need not include\nanything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary\nform) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the\noperating system on which the executable runs, unless that component\nitself accompanies the executable.\n\nIf distribution of executable or object code is made by offering\naccess to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent\naccess to copy the source code from the same place counts as\ndistribution of the source code, even though third parties are not\ncompelled to copy the source along with the object code.\n\n  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program\nexcept as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt\notherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is\nvoid, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.\nHowever, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under\nthis License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such\nparties remain in full compliance.\n\n  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not\nsigned it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or\ndistribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are\nprohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by\nmodifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and\nall its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying\nthe Program or works based on it.\n\n  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the\nProgram), the recipient automatically receives a license from the\noriginal licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to\nthese terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further\nrestrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.\nYou are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to\nthis License.\n\n  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent\ninfringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),\nconditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or\notherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not\nexcuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot\ndistribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this\nLicense and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you\nmay not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent\nlicense would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by\nall those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then\nthe only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to\nrefrain entirely from distribution of the Program.\n\nIf any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under\nany particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to\napply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other\ncircumstances.\n\nIt is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any\npatents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any\nsuch claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the\nintegrity of the free software distribution system, which is\nimplemented by public license practices.  Many people have made\ngenerous contributions to the wide range of software distributed\nthrough that system in reliance on consistent application of that\nsystem; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing\nto distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot\nimpose that choice.\n\nThis section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to\nbe a consequence of the rest of this License.\n\n  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in\ncertain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the\noriginal copyright holder who places the Program under this License\nmay add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding\nthose countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among\ncountries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates\nthe limitation as if written in the body of this License.\n\n  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions\nof the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will\nbe similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to\naddress new problems or concerns.\n\nEach version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program\nspecifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any\nlater version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions\neither of that version or of any later version published by the Free\nSoftware Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of\nthis License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software\nFoundation.\n\n  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free\nprograms whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author\nto ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free\nSoftware Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes\nmake exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals\nof preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and\nof promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.\n\n                            NO WARRANTY\n\n  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY\nFOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN\nOTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES\nPROVIDE THE PROGRAM \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS\nTO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE\nPROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,\nREPAIR OR CORRECTION.\n\n  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING\nWILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR\nREDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,\nINCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING\nOUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED\nTO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY\nYOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER\nPROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs\n\n  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest\npossible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it\nfree software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.\n\n  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

REQUIREMENTS\n\n3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:\n\n  a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in\n  accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany\n  the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program\n  is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to\n  obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily\n  used for software exchange; and\n\n  b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license\n  different than this Agreement, provided that such license:\n     i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     warranties and conditions, express and implied, including\n     warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and\n     implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness\n     for a particular purpose;\n\n     ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all\n     liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,\n     incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;\n\n     iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights\n     in the Source Code under section 3.2; and\n\n     iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any\n     party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements\n     of this section 3.\n\n3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:\n\n  a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the\n  Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or\n  files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial\n  Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in\n  Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available\n  under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and\n\n  b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of\n  the Program.\n\n3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,\ntrademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations\nof liability (\"notices\") contained within the Program from any copy of\nthe Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add\ntheir own appropriate notices.\n\n4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION\n\nCommercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities\nwith respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this\nlicense is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,\nthe Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product\noffering should do so in a manner which does not create potential\nliability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes\nthe Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor\n(\"Commercial Contributor\") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every\nother Contributor (\"Indemnified Contributor\") against any losses,\ndamages and costs (collectively \"Losses\") arising from claims, lawsuits\nand other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified\nContributor to the extent caused by the acts or omissions of such\nCommercial Contributor in connection with its distribution of the Program\nin a commercial product offering. The obligations in this section do not\napply to any claims or Losses relating to any actual or alleged\nintellectual property infringement. In order to qualify, an Indemnified\nContributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial Contributor in\nwriting of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor to control,\nand cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and any\nrelated settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may\nparticipate in any such claim at its own expense.\n\nFor example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial\nproduct offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial\nContributor. If that Commercial Contributor then makes performance\nclaims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance\nclaims and warranties are such Commercial Contributor's responsibility\nalone. Under this section, the Commercial Contributor would have to\ndefend claims against the other Contributors related to those performance\nclaims and warranties, and if a court requires any other Contributor to\npay any damages as a result, the Commercial Contributor must pay\nthose damages.\n\n5. NO WARRANTY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN \"AS IS\"\nBASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF\nTITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the\nappropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all\nrisks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement,\nincluding but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors,\ncompliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs\nor equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.\n\n6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY\n\nEXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, AND TO THE EXTENT\nPERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY CONTRIBUTORS\nSHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,\nEXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST\nPROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN\nCONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE)\nARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE\nEXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE\nPOSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n\n7. GENERAL\n\nIf any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under\napplicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\nthe remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further\naction by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the\nminimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.\n\nIf Recipient institutes patent litigation against any entity\n(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the\nProgram itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software\nor hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's\nrights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such\nlitigation is filed.\n\nAll Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it\nfails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this\nAgreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of\ntime after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's\nrights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use\nand distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.\nHowever, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses\ngranted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and survive.\n\nEveryone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement,\nbut in order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and\nmay only be modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward\nreserves the right to publish new versions (including revisions) of\nthis Agreement from time to time. No one other than the Agreement\nSteward has the right to modify this Agreement. The Eclipse Foundation\nis the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the\nresponsibility to serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate\nentity. Each new version of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing\nversion number. The Program (including Contributions) may always be\nDistributed subject to the version of the Agreement under which it was\nreceived. In addition, after a new version of the Agreement is published,\nContributor may elect to Distribute the Program (including its\nContributions) under the new version.\n\nExcept as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient\nreceives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property of any\nContributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by implication,\nestoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not expressly granted\nunder this Agreement are reserved. Nothing in this Agreement is intended\nto be enforceable by any entity that is not a Contributor or Recipient.\nNo third-party beneficiary rights are created under this Agreement.\n\nExhibit A - Form of Secondary Licenses Notice\n\n\"This Source Code may also be made available under the following\nSecondary Licenses when the conditions for such availability set forth\nin the Eclipse Public License, v. 2.0 are satisfied: {name license(s),\nversion(s), and exceptions or additional permissions here}.\"\n\n  Simply including a copy of this Agreement, including this Exhibit A\n  is not sufficient to license the Source Code under Secondary Licenses.\n\n  If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular\n  file, then You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE\n  file in a relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to\n  look for such a notice.\n\n  You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.",
