## 1. Pre-Release Steps
<!-- release: both -->

### 1.1 Announce Release
<!-- release: both -->

#### 1.1.1 Minor Release 1.x.0
<!-- release: minor -->

- Provide a heads-up to developers and the community two days before the release.

##### 1.1.1.1 GH Discussion
<!-- release: minor -->

- Use GitHub Discussions for the announcement in the [Category Release Announcements](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/discussions/new?category=release-announcements).

    Title:

    ```md
    Eclipse Theia v{{version}}
    ```

    Body:

    ```md
    Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹,

    The Eclipse Theia v{{version}} release is scheduled for **{{releaseDate}}**.

    Please use the Endgame issue below to track whatâ€™s included.
    If you have any nearly-complete PRs that should to be part of the release, please mention it in the endgame issue before we start:

    - https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/{{currentEndgameIssueNumber}}

    We'll post updates when the release begins and again once itâ€™s finished.
    Please avoid merging pull requests until we confirm the release is complete.
    ```

  - Pin discussion to the Release Announcement Category

- Refer to [this example](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/discussions/14547) for guidance.

##### 1.1.1.2 theia-dev mailing list
<!-- release: minor -->

- Also send an email to [the `theia-dev` mailing List](mailto:theia-dev@eclipse.org) (don't forget to add the link to the discussion):

    Subject:

    ```md
    Eclipse Theia version v{{version}}
    ```

    Body:

    ```md
    Hi everyone,

    The Eclipse Theia v{{version}} release is scheduled for {{releaseDate}}!
    You can follow the progress of the release here: https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/discussions/{{discussionNumber}}
    ```

#### 1.1.2 Patch Release 1.x.z
<!-- release: patch -->

- Provide a heads-up to developers and the community a few hours before the release.
- Use the [Release discussion](#111-minor-release-1x0) and post a comment to announce the patch release: <https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/discussions/{{discussionNumber}}>

  ```md
  We are preparing the patch release Eclipse Theia v{{version}}

  Follow the endgame checklist here:
  - https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/{{patchEndgameIssueNumber}}

  We'll post an update once the release is finished.
  ```

### 1.2 Localization
<!-- release: minor -->

- Perform `nls` updates before a release ([example](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/14373)).
- Trigger the automatic translation workflow via GitHub Actions ([workflow link](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/actions/workflows/translation.yml)).
- Force-push the branch created by the bot to properly trigger CI.
- Once the PR is approved, use `Squash and merge` to finalize it.
- DO NOT delete the bot's branch `bot/translation-update`

### 1.3 Prepare Release Branch
<!-- release: minor -->

- Checkout `master` with the latest changes:

  ```bash
  git pull
  ```

- Confirm the latest changes are present:

  ```bash
  git log
  ```

- Create a branch with the pattern `release/major.minor.x` (e.g., `release/1.55.x`).

  ```md
  release/{{majorMinor}}.x
  ```

### 1.4 Update Changelog
<!-- release: minor -->

Add entries for non-breaking changes since the last release. Breaking changes should be added by the PR, not during the release.

Commit the changelog changes with the message: `docs: update changelog for {version}`.

Format:

- Version and date as an H2 header (e.g., `## 1.55.0 - 10/31/2024`).
- Entries should:
  - Be prefixed with their extension name (e.g., `[core]`).
  - Start with a lowercase character and be in the past tense (e.g., 'added support...').
  - Be in alphabetical order.
  - Include a link to their corresponding pull request.
  - Specify contribution if applicable (e.g., Contributed on behalf of x).
  - Example: `[core] added support for Node 20.x [#pr-number](<link-to-pr>) - Contributed on behalf of x`.
- Breaking changes should be in a separate section (header: `<a name="breaking_changes_1.55.0">[Breaking Changes:](#breaking_changes_1.55.0)</a>`).

## 2. Release Process
<!-- release: both -->

### 2.1 Performing a Release
<!-- release: both -->

### 2.1.1 GH Discussion announcement
<!-- release: minor -->

- Announcement for Minor Release (x.x.0)
  - Announce that the release is starting as a comment in the [Release discussion](#111-minor-release-1x0): <https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/discussions/{{discussionNumber}}>

    ```md
    The release will start now. Weâ€™ll post an update once it has completed.
    ```

### 2.1.2 OPTION 1: Perform the release LOCALLY
<!-- release: both -->

### 2.1.2.1 Prepare the release locally
<!-- release: both -->

- Ensure the release branch is checked out (i.e., `release/{{majorMinor}}.x`).

- Clean the working directory:

  ```bash
  git clean -xdf
  ```

- Build the changes:

  ```bash
  npm install && npm run build
  ```

- Confirm the changes are built (ensure `@theia` extensions have their `lib/` folders).

### 2.1.2.2 Publish the release locally
<!-- release: both -->

- Create a short-lived granular npm auth token ([instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/creating-and-viewing-access-tokens#creating-granular-access-tokens-on-the-website)):
  - Expiration: `7 days`.
  - Under Packages and scopes:
    - Permissions: `Read and write`.
    - Select `Only select packages and scopes`
    - Select packages and scopes: `@theia`.

- Set the token:

  ```bash
   npm set "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${TOKEN}"
  ```

  _Note:_ Add a whitespace in front of this command to ensure it is not added to the shell's history (might not work for all shells).

### 2.1.2.2.1 Minor Release 1.x.0
<!-- release: minor -->

- Perform the release:

  ```bash
  npm run publish:latest
  ```

  Select the appropriate version.

- Verify the packages are published on npm and with the correct tag. (e.g., check the core package <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theia/core?activeTab=versions>)

- Remove the auth token:

  ```bash
  npm logout
  ```

### 2.1.2.2.2 Patch Release 1.x.z
<!-- release: patch -->

  _NOTE:_ For a patch release on an earlier version (e.g., 1.55.1 when 1.56.0 exists), use:

  ```bash
  npm run publish:patch
  ```
  
  For a patch to the current version use:

  ```bash
  npm run publish:latest
  ```

- Verify the packages are published on npm and with the correct tag. (e.g., check the core package <https://www.npmjs.com/package/@theia/core?activeTab=versions>)

- Remove the auth token:

  ```bash
  npm logout
  ```

### 2.1.2.3 Prepare the release branch
<!-- release: both -->

- Ensure the release branch is still checked out (i.e., `release/{{majorMinor}}.x`).

- Update `packages/core/README.md` in a commit ([example](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/commit/21fa2ec688e4a8bcf10203d6dc0f730af43a7f58)).

  Commit message:
  
  ```md
  core: update re-exports for v{{version}}
  ```

- Add other changes in a commit named `v{version}`.
- Make sure to update ALL packages to the new version (search & replace)

  Commit message:
  
  ```md
  v{{version}}
  ```

- Push the branch.

### 2.1.3 OPTION 2: Perform the release via GH WORKFLOW
<!-- release: both -->

- Run the [_Publish Release_](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/actions/workflows/publish-release.yml)
- Choose the release branch (i.e., `release/{{majorMinor}}.x`)
- Choose the respective release type and check the input option in case it is a patch for a previous version.

### 2.1.3.1 Check Package update PR
<!-- release: both -->

- The workflow automatically creates a PR to update the package versions for the release branch, see [example here](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16438)
- Follow the instructions in the PR, to ensure all package versions are updated and change the author of the commits to you.
- Wait for the checks to succeed, then merge using `Rebase and Merge`.

### 2.1.4 Native dependencies
<!-- release: both -->

- Once the release branch has been updated (package updates):
  - Get the `native dependencies`
    - Run the [_Package Native Dependencies_](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/actions/workflows/native-dependencies.yml) GitHub Action on the release branch (You can continue while you wait).
    - Download the artifacts (They are located on the build overview at the bottom).
    - Extract the downloaded folders.
    - Leave the dependencies for now, you will need them later.

### 2.1.5 Create the release PR against main
<!-- release: minor -->

- Create a PR against main (not needed for patch releases): <https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/compare>
  
  PR Title:
  
  ```md
  Theia v{{version}}
  ```

  - Wait for approval.
  - Merge using `Rebase and Merge` (**DO NOT `Squash and Merge`**).

- See for example: <https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16333>

### 2.1.6 Create the annotated Git Tag
<!-- release: both -->

- Tag the publishing commit after merging (for patch releases, tag directly on the release branch):

  ```bash
  git tag -a v{{version}} ${sha} -m "v{{version}}"
  ```

  _Note_: The tag needs to be annotated otherwise it might break the publishing. Check that the output of the following command is `tag` and not `commit`.

  ```bash
  git for-each-ref refs/tags | grep 'v{{version}}' | awk '{print $2}'
  ```

- Push the tag:

  ```bash
  git push origin v{{version}}
  ```

### 2.1.7 Create the GH Release - Minor Release 1.x.0
<!-- release: minor -->

- Create a GitHub release:
  - Draft a release on the [releases page](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/releases/new).
  - Choose the appropriate `tag` and input the release title from below.
  - Use `generate release notes` for contributors and format like previous releases.
  - Reference the `changelog` and breaking changes.
  - Attach _Native Dependencies_ artifacts (the extracted zips).
    - native-dependencies-darwin-arm64.zip

  ```

- Mark the message as the answer

- Also send an email to [the `theia-dev` mailing List](mailto:theia-dev@eclipse.org):

    Subject:

    ```md
    Eclipse Theia v{{version}} patch release
    ```

    Body:

    ```md
    Hi everyone,

    The Eclipse Theia v{{version}} patch release has been published!
    See the release on GitHub for more information: https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/releases/tag/v{{version}}
    ```

### 3.3 Update Future Milestones
<!-- release: minor -->

- Close the current release [milestone](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/milestones).
- Create the next two milestones if they do not already exist. Releases are typically on the last Thursday of the month, with possible exceptions.

### 3.4 Merge Website PRs
<!-- release: minor -->

- Merge all [website PRs marked with label `merge with next release`](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-website/labels/merge%20with%20next%20release)

### 3.5 Publish GitHub Pages
<!-- release: minor -->

- Publish the `latest` documentation with the [GitHub Pages workflow](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/actions/workflows/publish-gh-pages.yml) manually using the `manual_dispatch` job.

### 3.6 Update Major Dependencies
<!-- release: minor -->

After each release, check the following major dependencies for version updates:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) - Check for LTS versions and security updates
- [React](https://react.dev/versions) - Review latest stable releases
- [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/electron-timelines)
  - Evaluate supported versions and review [Breaking changes](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/breaking-changes) for anything that may affect usage.

For each dependency requiring an update, [create a ticket](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) using the following template:

Title:

```md
Update [DEPENDENCY_NAME] to version X.Y.Z
```

Description:

```md
Update [DEPENDENCY_NAME] to stay up-to-date and consume (security) fixes.

- Current version: [CURRENT_VERSION]
- Target version: [TARGET_VERSION]

After updating the dependency, please [open a ticket for the Theia IDE](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-ide/issues/new?template=feature_request.md) and assign the `toDoWithRelease` and `dependencies` labels.
This indicates that the update needs to be done in Theia IDE as well and ensures it will be addressed with the next release.
```

If certain updates need to be done together (e.g. new electron version requires newer node version) feel free to group the tickets together.

Assign the ticket to @ndoschek.

Once the ticket is created, @ndoschek will evaluate and assign it to the appropriate person for implementation.

### 3.7 NPM Upgrade
<!-- release: minor -->

Perform a `npm upgrade` on the repository after the release to update the `package-lock.json`. The upgrade helps to:

- Better represent what adopters will pull during a release.
- Validate dependencies with our declared version ranges.
- Fix known security vulnerabilities from dependencies.

To perform the upgrade:

- Run `npm upgrade` at the root of the repository.
- Fix any compilation errors, typing errors, and failing tests.
- Open a PR with the changes ([example](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/15688)).
- Run the license check review locally
- Wait for the "IP Check" to complete ([example](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/emo-team/iplab/-/issues/9377)).

Performing this after the release helps us to find issues with the new dependencies and gives time to perform a license check on the dependencies.

## 4. Troubleshooting
<!-- release: both -->

### 4.1 Failures During Publishing
<!-- release: both -->

If `lerna` fails during publishing (e.g., socket errors), use the following commands to reset and retry:

- Reset the repository:

  ```bash
  git reset --hard
  ```

- Retry publishing only the unpublished packages:

  ```bash
  npx lerna publish from-package --no-git-reset --no-git-tag-version --no-push
  ```
