# Pull Requests

This document clarifies rules and expectations of contributing and reviewing pull requests.
It is structured as a list of rules which can be referenced on a PR to moderate and drive discussions.
If a rule causes distress during discussions itself, it has to be reviewed on [the dev meeting](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/wiki/Dev-Meetings) and updated.

## Opening a Pull Request

<a name="pr-template"></a>
- [1.](#pr-template) Each PR description has to follow the following template:

  ```md
  <!--
  Thank you for your Pull Request. Please provide a description and review
  the requirements below.

  Contributors guide: https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
  -->

  #### What it does
  <!-- Include relevant issues and describe how they are addressed. -->

  #### How to test
  <!-- Explain how a reviewer can reproduce a bug, test new functionality or verify performance improvements. -->

  #### Review checklist

  - [ ] As an author, I have thoroughly tested my changes and carefully followed [the review guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/doc/pull-requests.md#requesting-a-review)

  #### Reminder for reviewers

  - As a reviewer, I agree to review in accordance with [the review guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/doc/pull-requests.md#reviewing)
  ```

<a name="design-review"></a>
- [2.](#design-review) A PR can be opened early for the design review before going into the detailed implementation.
  - A request on the design review should be an explicit comment.
  - Such PR should be marked as a draft or with the WIP prefix.

<a name="fixups"></a>
- [3.](#fixups) Changes done _after_ the PR has been opened should be kept in separate commits until the review process is finished. This allows reviewers to re-review only the updated parts of the PR and to determine what needs to be tested again. The "fixup" commits must be squashed before merging in order to keep a clean history.

## Requesting a Review

### Approving

### Collaborating

<a name="completing-pr"></a>
- [2.](#completing-pr) If a PR is important, but an author cannot or does not want to address outstanding issues,
then maintainers can complete the PR with additional commits
provided that the original author accepted the [ECA](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#eclipse-contributor-agreement) and their commits are preserved - the original author's work should not be squashed away.
<a name="suggesting-help-on-pr"></a>

  - CI build has succeeded.
  - The author has accepted the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#eclipse-contributor-agreement).
  - All checks from [the review checklist](#pull-request-review-checklist) are approved by at least one reviewer.
  - There are no unresolved review comments.
<a name="merging-pr"></a>
- [2.](#merging-pr) Pull requests satisfying the criteria above should be merged in a timely fashion to avoid a buildup of approved PR's at release time. Responsibility for merging a PR falls to

  - The approving reviewer, otherwise.

## Reverting

- [1.](#closing-pr) A reviewer cannot close a PR without a reason.
<a name="closing-pr-reasons"></a>
- [2.](#closing-pr-reasons) A PR may be closed, for example, because of the following reasons:
  - It introduces functionality which should be implemented as external Theia or VS Code extensions.
  - It introduces structural or API changes between core extensions.
  Such changes have to be done by an experienced maintainer to avoid regressions and long reviews.
  - It should be a 3rd party component, e.g. Theia is not a logging framework or a proxy server.
  - It changes development infrastructure, e.g. testing frameworks, packaging and so on.
Such changes have to be done by active maintainers after agreement in [the dev meeting](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/wiki/Dev-Meetings).
