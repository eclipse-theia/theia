This file contains tips to help you take (and understand) your first steps in
the world of Theia development. Are you in a hurry? See the
[Quick Start](#quick-start).

# How to build Theia and the example applications
Theia is a framework to build IDEs, so you can't really "run" Theia itself.
However, you can run the example applications included in its repository. One
is a browser-based IDE and the other is the Electron-based equivalent.

The following instructions are for Linux and macOS.

## Prerequisites

 - Node.js `>= 12.14.1` **AND** `< 13`.
   - Preferably, **use** Node version [`12.14.1`](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v12.14.1/), as it is the recommended minimum version according to the framework's supported `electron` version.
 - [Yarn package manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)  `>= 1.7.0` **AND** `< 2.x.x`.
 - git (If you would like to use the Git-extension too, you will need to have git version 2.11.0 or higher.)

Some additional tools and libraries are needed depending on your platform:

- Linux
  - [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
  - [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) (or another compiling toolchain)
  - [pkg-config](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/)
  - build-essential: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
  - Dependencies for `native-keymap` node native extension:
    - Debian-based: `sudo apt-get install libx11-dev libxkbfile-dev`
    - Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libX11-devel.x86_64 libxkbfile-devel.x86_64 # or .i686`
    - FreeBSD: `sudo pkg install libX11`

- Linux/MacOS
  - [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended to easily switch between Node.js versions.

- Windows
  - We recommend using [`scoop`](https://scoop.sh/). The detailed steps are [here](#building-on-windows).

## Quick Start

To build and run the browser example:

    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia \
    && cd theia \
    && yarn \
    && cd examples/browser \
    && yarn run start

Start your browser on http://localhost:3000.

To build and run the Electron example:

    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia \
    && cd theia \
    && yarn \
    && yarn run rebuild:electron \
    && cd examples/electron \
    && yarn run start

### Run the browser example with SSL

To run the browser example using SSL use:

    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia \
    && cd theia \
    && yarn \
    && cd examples/browser \
    && yarn run start --ssl --cert /path/to/cert.crt --certkey /path/to/certkey.key

Start your browser on https://localhost:3000.

### Run the browser example with Gitpod

[Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) is a Theia-based IDE for GitHub.
You can start by prefixing any GitHub URL in the Theia repository with `gitpod.io/#`:
- Open https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia to start development with the master branch.
- Gitpod will start a properly configured for Theia development workspace, clone and build the Theia repository.
- After the build is finished, run from the terminal in Gitpod:

        cd examples/browser \
        && yarn run start ../.. --hostname 0.0.0.0

## Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia

The directory containing the Theia repository will now be referred to as
`$THEIA`, so if you want to copy-paste the examples, you can set the `THEIA`
variable in your shell:

    THEIA=$PWD/theia

## The repository structure

Theia repository has multiple folders:

 - `packages` folder contains runtime packages, as the core package and extensions to it
 - `dev-packages` folder contains devtime packages
    - [@theia/cli](../dev-packages/cli/README.md) is a command line tool to manage Theia applications
    - [@theia/ext-scripts](../dev-packages/ext-scripts/README.md) is a command line tool to share scripts between Theia runtime packages
 - `examples` folder contains example applications, both Electron-based and browser-based
 - `doc` folder provides documentation about how Theia works
 - `scripts` folder contains JavaScript scripts used by npm scripts when
installing
- the root folder lists dev dependencies and wires everything together with [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/)

## Build core, extensions and examples packages

You can download dependencies and build it using:

    cd $THEIA
    yarn

This command downloads dev dependencies, links and builds all packages.
To learn more and understand precisely what's going on, please look at scripts in [package.json](../package.json).

### Skip lint

Linter can be skipped by setting the `SKIP_LINT` environment variable to `true`.

example:
```
cd $THEIA
SKIP_LINT=true yarn
```

## Build extension packages individually

From the root:

 `npx run build @theia/package-name`

From the package:

`yarn --ignore-scripts && yarn build`

## Run the browser-based example application

We can start the application from the [examples/browser](../examples/browser) directory with:

    yarn run start

This command starts the backend application listening on port `3000`. The frontend application should be available on http://localhost:3000.

If you rebuild native Node.js packages for Electron then rollback these changes
before starting the browser example by running from the root directory:

    yarn run rebuild:browser

## Run the Electron-based example application

From the root directory run:

    yarn run rebuild:electron

This command rebuilds native Node.js packages against the version of Node.js
used by Electron.

It can also be started from the [examples/electron](../examples/electron) directory with:

    yarn run start

## Rebuilding

In the root directory run:

    yarn run build

## Watching

### Watch the core and extension packages

To rebuild each time a change is detected run:

    yarn run watch

### Watch the examples

To rebuild each time a change is detected in frontend or backend you can run:

    yarn run watch

### Watch a specific package

You can use `npx` to watch a single package:

    npx run watch @theia/the-package-name

### Watch a specific package and its local upstream dependencies

Let assume you have to work for instance in the `@theia/navigator` extension. But you might have to apply changes in any of its upstream dependencies such as `@theia/filesystem` or `@theia/core`, you can either do `yarn watch` which could be super expensive, as it watches all the packages. Or you can do `npx run watch @theia/navigator` and `npx run watch @theia/filesystem` and `npx run watch @theia/core` in three individual shells. Or you can do the following single-liner:

    npx run watch @theia/navigator --include-filtered-dependencies --parallel

## Debugging

### Debug the browser example's backend

 - Open the debug view and run the `Launch Browser Backend` configuration.

### Debug the browser example's frontend

 - Start the backend by using `yarn run start`.
 - In a browser: Open http://localhost:3000/ and use the dev tools for debugging.
 - Open the debug view and run the `Launch Browser Frontend` configuration.

### Debug the browser example's frontend and backend at the same time

 - Open the debug view and run the `Launch Browser Backend` configuration.
 - Then run the `Launch Browser Frontend` configuration.

### Debug the Electron example's backend

 - Open the debug view and run the `Launch Electron Backend` configuration.

### Debug the Electron example's frontend

 - Start the Electron backend
   - Either open the debug view and run the `Launch Electron Backend` configuration
   - Or use `yarn run start`.
 - Attach to the Electron Frontend
   - Either open the debug view and run the `Attach to Electron Frontend` configuration
   - Or in Electron: Help -> Toggle Electron Developer Tools.

### Debug the Electron example's frontend and backend at the same time

 - Open the debug view and run the `Launch Electron Backend & Frontend` configuration.

### Debug IPC servers

  - Pass `--${server-name}-inspect` arg to the backend server.
    - For example `--nfsw-watcher-inspect=0` to inspect nfsw watcher processes with dynamic port allocation.
    - All variations of `--inspect` flag are supported: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/#command-line-options.
  - Attach the debugger to the logged port.

In order to look up `server-name` run the backend server with `--log-level=debug` flag to enable logging of IPC servers instantiation.
You should be able to see message of `[${server-name}: ${server-PID}]: IPC started` format, like `[nsfw-watcher: 37557] IPC started`.

### Debug the plugin host

  - Pass `--hosted-plugin-inspect=9339` arg to the backend server from the command line.
    - Instead you can run `Launch Browser Backend` launch configuration which is already pre-configured.
  - Open the debug view and run the `Attach to Plugin Host` launch configuration.
    - It connects to the plugin host if at least one extension is detected, otherwise it timeouts after 60s.
    - If you want to debug the activation then enable `stopOnEntry` flag.
  - Open the browser page.

### Debugging Plugin Sources

[click for base article](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues/3251#issuecomment-468166533)

The following launch configuration is meant to be used when the Theia project is opened as the main project in vscode, the following launch configuration is added inside .vscode/launch.json.
- The source repository of your plugin is expected under your `${workspaceFolder}/plugins` folder
- You can start the frontend from URL: http://localhost:3030
- It's suggested to update your frontend launch configuration URL to open your favorite target project in a second launch

Launch configuration template that will start the backend process, and then attempt to connect on port 9339 to debug the plugin-host sub-process:

```jsonc
{
    "name": "Launch VS Code extension as Theia plugin",
    "type": "node",
    "request": "launch",
    "port": 9339,
    "timeout": 100000,
    "args": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/examples/browser/src-gen/backend/main.js",
        "${workspaceFolder}",
        "--port=3030",
        "--hosted-plugin-inspect=9339", // spawn the plugin-host in debug mode
        "--plugins=local-dir:${workspaceFolder}/plugins"
    ],
    "stopOnEntry": false,
    "sourceMaps": true,
    "outFiles": [
        "${workspaceFolder}/**/*.js"
    ],
    "internalConsoleOptions": "openOnSessionStart",
    "outputCapture": "std"
}
```

#### Producing typescript maps for your plugin

Enable source maps in the plugin's `tsconfig.json`

```jsonc
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "sourceMap": true
    }
}
```

If Webpack is used you should bundle in development mode in the `package.json` scripts to avoid minification:

```sh
webpack --mode development
```

As well as enabling source map output in the **webpack.config.js**

```js
module.exports = {
    devtool: 'source-map'
}
```

#### Compiling and blocking typescript from walking up parent directories [(see discussion)](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/13992#issuecomment-386253983)

If you get errors while building like:

```
(parent folders)/index.d.ts: error TS2300: Duplicate identifier
```

You can fix it by modifying your `tsconfig.json`:

```jsonc
{
    "compilerOptions": {
       "typeRoots": ["./node_modules/@types"]
    }
}
```

## Profiling

 - Use Chrome devtools to profile both the frontend and backend (Node.js).
   - For Node.js: open chrome://inspect, click the configure button and ensure target host and port are listed.
 - Learn how to get and understand CPU measurements: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/
 - Learn how to get and understand Memory measurements: https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/memory-problems/
 - Before taking the memory snapshot always collect garbage.
 - Make sure that Chrome extensions don't distort measurements by disabling them.
   - For frontend: React extension is leaking components.
 - Make measurements before and after improvements to provide them as evidence on a pull request.
   - Also document how to reproduce improved measurements in `How to test` section of a pull request description.
 - If objects don't have a proper class, i.e. plain JSON, then find one of them in the first snapshot
 and check that it is garbage collected in the diff between snapshots.

### Profile the frontend process

  - In Browser: open the devtools.
  - In Electron: Help -> Toggle Electron Developer Tools.

### Profile the backend process

  - Pass `--inspect` arg to the backend server: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/#command-line-options.

### Profile IPC servers

  - Pass `--${server-name}-inspect` arg to the backend server.
    - For example `--nfsw-watcher-inspect=0` to inspect nfsw watcher processes with dynamic port allocation.
    - All variations of `--inspect` flag are supported: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/#command-line-options.

### Profile the plugin host

 - Pass `--hosted-plugin-inspect` arg to the backend server.
   - All variations of `--inspect` flag are supported: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/#command-line-options.

## Testing

- See the [unit testing](Testing.md) documentation.
- See the [API integration testing](api-testing.md) documentation.

## Code coverage

    yarn run test

By default, this will generate the code coverage for the tests in an HTML
format, which can be easily viewed with your browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge/Safari
etc.) by opening `packages/<package name>/coverage/index.html`.

## Building on Windows

 - Install [`scoop`](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop#installation).
 - Install [`nvm`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) with scoop: `scoop install nvm`.
 - Install Node.js with `nvm`: `nvm install 12.14.1`, then use it: `nvm use 12.14.1`. You can list all available Node.js versions with `nvm list available` if you want to pick another version.
 - Install `yarn`: `scoop install yarn`.
 - Install [`windows-build-tools`](https://github.com/felixrieseberg/windows-build-tools). Run `PowerShell` as _Administrator_ and copy paste the following: `npm --add-python-to-path install --global --production windows-build-tools`

Clone, build and run Theia.
Using Git Bash as administrator:

    git clone https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia.git && cd theia && yarn && yarn --cwd examples\browser start

If you do not have Git Bash installed on your system, [get one](https://gitforwindows.org/), or use `scoop`: `scoop install git`.

## Troubleshooting

> First make sure that you follow the steps given in the [docs](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/blob/master/doc/Developing.md#run-the-browser-based-example-applicatio) correctly.

### Linux

The start command will start a watcher on many files in the theia directory.
To avoid ENOSPC errors, increase your default inotify watches.

It can be done like so:

    echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p

### Windows

If you see `LINK : fatal error LNK1104: cannot open file 'C:\\Users\\path\\to\\node.lib' [C:\path\to\theia\node_modules\drivelist\build\drivelist.vcxproj]`, then set the Visual Studio version manually with `npm config set msvs_version 2017 --global`. Note, if you have `2015` installed, use `2015` instead of `2017.`

If you are facing with `EPERM: operation not permitted` or `permission denied`
errors while building, testing or running the application then;

 - You don't have write access to the installation directory.
 - Try to run your command line (`PowerShell`, `GitBash`, `Cygwin` or whatever
 you are using) as an administrator.
 - The permissions in the NPM cache might get corrupted. Please try to run
 `npm cache clean` to fix them.
 - If you experience issues such as `Error: EBUSY: resource busy or locked, rename`,
 try to disable (or uninstall) your anti-malware software.
 See [here](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/13461#issuecomment-282556281).
 - Still having issues on Windows? File a [bug]. We are working on Linux or OS X
 operating systems. Hence we are more than happy to receive any Windows-related
 feedbacks, [bug](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/issues) reports.

If you're still struggling with the build but you use Windows 10, the you can enable the `Windows Subsystem for Linux` and you can get a Linux distro for free.

### macOS

You need to have the Xcode command line tools installed in order to build and run Theia. You can install the tools by running

    xcode-select --install

If you already have Xcode installed, but you see the `xcode-select: error: tool 'xcodebuild' requires Xcode, but active developer directory '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools' is a command line tools instance` error, you need to run the following command to fix it: `sudo xcode-select --switch /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools`.

The solution is the same if you have updated to `10.14` (Mojave) and you can see the `gyp: No Xcode or CLT version detected!` error. More details [here](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-macos).

### Root privileges errors
When trying to install with root privileges, you might encounter errors such as
`cannot run in wd`.

Several options are available to you:

 - Install without root privileges
 - Use the `--unsafe-perm` flag: `yarn --unsafe-perm`
