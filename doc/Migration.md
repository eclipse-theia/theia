# Migration Guide

## Description

The following guide highlights potential migration steps necessary during `theia` upgrades discovered when adopting the framework.
Please see the latest version (`master`) for the most up-to-date information. Please contribute any issues you experienced when upgrading to a newer version of Theia to this document, even for previous releases.

## Guide

### v1.17.0

#### ES2017

- Theia was updated to ES2017
  - es5 VS Code extensions and Theia plugins are still supported
  - If you require an es5 codebase you should be able to transpile back to es5 using webpack
  - The following code transpiles back to an es2015 codebase:
    ```
    config.module.rules.push({
        test: /\.js$/,
        use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
                presets: [['@babel/preset-env', { targets: { chrome: '58', ie: '11' } }]],
            }
        }
    });
    ```
  - Replace the targets with the ones that are needed for your use case
  - Make sure to use `inversify@5.1.1`. Theia requires `inversify@^5.0.1` which means that `5.1.1` is compatible,
    but your lockfile might reference an older version.

### v1.16.0

[Release](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/releases/tag/v1.16.0)

- N/A.

### v1.15.0

[Release](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/releases/tag/v1.15.0)

#### Keytar:

- [`keytar`](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) was added as a dependency for the secrets API. and may require `libsecret` in your particular distribution to be functional:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
  - Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
  - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`
  - Alpine: `apk add libsecret-dev`
- It is possible that a `yarn resolution` is necessary for `keytar` to work on older distributions (the fix was added in `1.16.0` by downgrading the dependency version):

  ```json
  "resolutions": {
    "**/keytar": "7.6.0",
  }
  ```

- `keytar` uses [`prebuild-install`](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuild-install) to download prebuilt binaries. If you are experiencing issues where some shared libraries are missing from the system it was originally built upon, you can tell `prebuild-install` to build the native extension locally by setting the environment variable before performing `yarn`:

  ```sh
  # either:
  export npm_config_build_from_source=true
  yarn
  # or:
  npm_config_build_from_source=true yarn
  ```

#### Webpack

- The version of webpack was upgraded from 4 to 5 and may require additional shims to work properly given an application's particular setup.
- The `webpack` dependency may need to be updated if there are errors when performing a `production` build of the application due to a bogus `webpack-sources` dependency. The valid `webpack` version includes `^5.36.2 <5.47.0`. If necessary, you can use a `yarn resolution` to fix the issue:

  ```json
  "resolutions": {
    "**/webpack": "5.46.0",
  }
  ```
