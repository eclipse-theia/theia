# Migration Guide

## Description

The following guide highlights potential migration steps necessary during `theia` upgrades discovered when adopting the framework.
Please see the latest version (`master`) for the most up-to-date information. Please contribute any issues you experienced when upgrading to a newer version of Theia to this document, even for previous releases.

## Guide

### General

Due to a [colors.js](https://github.com/Marak/colors.js) issue, a [resolution](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) may be necessary for your application in order to workaround the problem:

For example:

```json
"resolutions": {
    "**/colors": "<=1.4.0"
}
```

### v1.24.0

#### node-gyp 8.4.1

The `electron-rebuild` dependency was upgraded which in turn upgraded `node-gyp` to `v8.4.1`.
This version of `node-gyp` does not support **Python2** (which is EOL) so **Python3** is necessary during the build.

#### From WebSocket to Socket.io

This is a very important change to how Theia sends and receives messages with its backend.

This new Socket.io protocol will try to establish a WebSocket connection whenever possible, but it may also
setup HTTP polling. It may even try to connect through HTTP before attempting WebSocket.

Make sure your network configurations support both WebSockets and/or HTTP polling.

### v1.23.0

#### TypeScript 4.5.5

If you are using TypeScript <= 4.5.5 and you encounter issues when building your Theia application because your compiler fails to parse our type definitions,
then you should upgrade to TypeScript >= 4.5.5.

#### Socket.io

If you are deploying multiple Theia nodes behind a load balancer, you will have to enable sticky-sessions,
as it is now required by the new WebSocket implementation using Socket.io protocol.

For more details, see the socket.io documentation about [using multiple nodes](https://socket.io/docs/v4/using-multiple-nodes/#enabling-sticky-session).

### v1.22.0

#### Electron Update

Electron got updated from 9 to 15, this might involve some modifications in your code based on the new APIs.

See Electron's [documentation](https://github.com/electron/electron/tree/15-x-y/docs).

Most notably the `electron.remote` API got deprecated and replaced with a `@electron/remote` package.

Theia makes use of that package and re-exports it as `@theia/core/electron-shared/@electron/remote`.

See `@theia/core` re-exports [documentation](../packages/core/README.md#re-exports).

Lastly, Electron must now be defined in your application's `package.json` under `devDependencies`.

`theia build` will automatically add the entry and prompt you to re-install your dependencies when out of sync.

### v1.21.0

#### Frontend Source Maps

The frontend's source map naming changed. If you had something like the following in your debug configurations:

```json
      "sourceMapPathOverrides": {
        "webpack://@theia/example-electron/*": "${workspaceFolder}/examples/electron/*"
      }
```

You can delete this whole block and replace it by the following:

```json
      "webRoot": "${workspaceFolder}/examples/electron"
```

### v1.17.0

#### ES2017

- Theia was updated to ES2017
  - es5 VS Code extensions and Theia plugins are still supported
  - If you require an es5 codebase you should be able to transpile back to es5 using webpack
  - The following code transpiles back to an es2015 codebase:
    ```
    config.module.rules.push({
        test: /\.js$/,
        use: {
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
                presets: [['@babel/preset-env', { targets: { chrome: '58', ie: '11' } }]],
            }
        }
    });
    ```
  - Replace the targets with the ones that are needed for your use case
  - Make sure to use `inversify@5.1.1`. Theia requires `inversify@^5.0.1` which means that `5.1.1` is compatible,
    but your lockfile might reference an older version.

### v1.16.0

[Release](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/releases/tag/v1.16.0)

- N/A.

### v1.15.0

[Release](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/releases/tag/v1.15.0)

#### Keytar:

- [`keytar`](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) was added as a dependency for the secrets API. and may require `libsecret` in your particular distribution to be functional:
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
  - Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
  - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`
  - Alpine: `apk add libsecret-dev`
- It is possible that a `yarn resolution` is necessary for `keytar` to work on older distributions (the fix was added in `1.16.0` by downgrading the dependency version):

  ```json
  "resolutions": {
    "**/keytar": "7.6.0",
  }
  ```

- `keytar` uses [`prebuild-install`](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuild-install) to download prebuilt binaries. If you are experiencing issues where some shared libraries are missing from the system it was originally built upon, you can tell `prebuild-install` to build the native extension locally by setting the environment variable before performing `yarn`:

  ```sh
  # either:
  export npm_config_build_from_source=true
  yarn
  # or:
  npm_config_build_from_source=true yarn
  ```

#### Webpack

- The version of webpack was upgraded from 4 to 5 and may require additional shims to work properly given an application's particular setup.
- The `webpack` dependency may need to be updated if there are errors when performing a `production` build of the application due to a bogus `webpack-sources` dependency. The valid `webpack` version includes `^5.36.2 <5.47.0`. If necessary, you can use a `yarn resolution` to fix the issue:

  ```json
  "resolutions": {
    "**/webpack": "5.46.0",
  }
  ```
