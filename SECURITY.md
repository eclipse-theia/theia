# Eclipse Theia Vulnerability Reporting Policy

If you think or suspect that you have discovered a new security vulnerability
in this project, please __do not__ disclose it on GitHub, e.g. in an issue, a
PR, or a discussion. Any such disclosure will be removed/deleted on sight, to
promote orderly disclosure, as per the Eclipse Foundation Security Policy (1).

Instead, please report any potential vulnerability to the Eclipse Foundation [Security Team](https://www.eclipse.org/security/). Make sure to provide a concise description of the issue, a CWE, and other supporting information.
