<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - ESLINT PLUGIN</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/eslint-plugin` contributes rules useful for Eclipse Theia development.
The plugin helps identify problems during development through static analysis including code quality, potential issues and code smells.

## Rules

### `localization-check`:

The rule prevents the following localization related issues:
- incorrect usage of the `nls.localizeByDefault` function by using an incorrect default value.
- unnecessary call to `nls.localize` which could be replaced by `nls.localizeByDefault`.

### `no-src-import`:

The rule prevents imports using `/src/` rather than `/lib/` as it causes build failures.
The rule helps developers more easily identify the cause of build errors caused by the incorrect import.

#### `runtime-import-check`:

The rule prevents imports from folders meant for incompatible runtimes.
The check enforces the [code organization guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/wiki/Code-Organization) of the framework and guards against invalid imports which may cause unforeseen issues downstream.

#### `shared-dependencies`:

The rule prevents the following:
- prevents the implicit use of a shared dependency from `@theia/core`.
- prevents extensions from depending on a shared dependency without re-using it from `@theia/core`.
