<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - ESLINT PLUGIN</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/eslint-plugin` contributes rules useful for Eclipse Theia development.
The plugin helps identify problems during development through static analysis including code quality, potential issues and code smells.

## Rules

#### `runtime-import-check`:

The rule prevents imports from folders meant for incompatible runtimes.
The check enforces the [code organization guidelines](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/wiki/Code-Organization) of the framework and guards against invalid imports which may cause unforeseen issues downstream.

#### `shared-dependencies`:

The rule prevents the following:
- prevents the implicit use of a shared dependency from `@theia/core`.
- prevents extensions from depending on a shared dependency without re-using it from `@theia/core`.
