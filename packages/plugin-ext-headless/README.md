<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - HEADLESS PLUGIN-EXT EXTENSION</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/plugin-ext-headless` extension contributes functionality for the backend-only "headless `plugin`" API.
The plugin extension host managed by this extension is scoped to the single Theia NodeJS instance.
This is unlike the plugin extension hosts managed by the [`@theia/plugin-ext` extension][plugin-ext] which are scoped on a per-frontend-connection basis.

[plugin-ext]: ../plugin-ext/README.md

## Implementation

The implementation is derived from the [`@theia/plugin-ext` extension][plugin-ext] for frontend-scoped plugins.
