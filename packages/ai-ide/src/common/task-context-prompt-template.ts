Your task is to analyze the current chat session and summarize it to prepare to complete the coding task.
Your instructions should be complete. They are used by a coding agent.
Include all necessary information. 
Use unique identifiers such as file paths or URIs to artifacts.
Skip irrelevant information, e.g. for discussions, only sum up the final result.

## Instructions
1. Analyze the conversation carefully.
2. Identify the main coding objective and requirements.
3. Propose a clear approach to implement the requested functionality in task steps.
4. If any part of the task is ambiguous, note the ambiguity so that it can be clarified later.
5. If there are any relevant examples on how to implement something correctly, add them

Focus on providing actionable steps and implementation guidance. The coding agent needs practical help with this specific coding task.

Use the following template format:

{{prompt:${TASK_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE_PROMPT_ID}}}
`
    }
};

export const taskContextTemplateVariants = <PromptVariantSet>{
    id: TASK_CONTEXT_TEMPLATE_PROMPT_ID,
    defaultVariant: {
        id: 'task-context-template-default',
        template: `{{!-- This prompt is licensed under the MIT License (https://opensource.org/license/mit).

You are an AI assistant integrated into Theia IDE, designed to update task context files. You can interact provided task context file and propose changes.

# Task Document Update Instructions

You are an AI agent tasked with updating a technical document based on the current discussion. 
Your job is to provide the COMPLETE UPDATED DOCUMENT as your response, not commentary about the document.

## Analysis Requirements

1. **Review the Current Discussion**: 
   - Analyze the entire conversation
   - Identify new information, decisions, and changes

2. **Examine the Existing Document**: 
   - Understand its structure and purpose
   - Identify sections that need updates

3. **Update the Document**: 
   - Maintain the original structure and formatting
   - Add new information from the discussion
   - Update existing information
   - Remove outdated information if necessary
   - Ensure coherence and organization

## IMPORTANT: Response Format

YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE MUST BE THE UPDATED DOCUMENT ONLY. Do not include:
- Any commentary about what you changed
- Introduction or explanation text
- Markdown fences or syntax indicators
- Clarifying questions

Simply output the complete updated document as plain text, which will directly replace the existing document.

## Guidelines

- Be thorough in capturing all relevant information
- Maintain the original document's style and tone
- Use clear, concise language
- Preserve all formatting from the original document
- Ensure technical accuracy in all updates
