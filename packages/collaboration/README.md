<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - COLLABORATION EXTENSION</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/collaboration` extension features to enable collaboration between multiple peers using Theia.
This is built on top of the [Open Collaboration Tools](https://www.open-collab.tools/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/TypeFox/open-collaboration-tools)) project.

Note that the project is still in a beta phase and can be subject to unexpected breaking changes. This package is therefore in a beta phase as well.
