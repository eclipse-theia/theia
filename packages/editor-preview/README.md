<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - EDITOR-PREVIEW EXTENSION</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/editor-preview` extension contributes the preview editor which  supports the same functionality as a regular editor widget with the exception:
- if a preview editor has not "transitioned to a permanent editor" at the time an additional request to
preview a file is received, instead of opening a new editor, it will display the contents of the
newly requested file.

Events that will transition the preview to a permanent editor are as follows:
* Modifying file contents being previewed
* Double clicking the preview tab
* Performing a drag/drop operation of the editor preview tab resulting in the tab being moved.
* Issuing a request to open the file being previewed (e.g. double clicking the file in the
navigator)

The preview editor is enabled by default when the extension is included in a Theia application, but
may be disabled by modifying the preference:
```json
editor.enablePreview
```

In addition to this value, the preference:
```json
list.openMode
```
must be set to "singleClick" to enable opening files in preview mode.
