<h2>THEIA - GETTING-STARTED EXTENSION</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/getting-started` extension contributes a default `getting-started` widget which is displayed whenever
opening the application without any workspace present or if the widget is explicitly opened (through the menu or command).

The `getting-started` widget provides useful commands and functionality for quickly getting up to speed with the application. For example:
- `open commands`: commands which are used to open files, folders, and workspaces quickly.
- `recent workspaces`: recently used workspaces are listed for easy and quick access.
- `settings commands`: commands which are used to open the preferences and keyboard shortcuts widgets.
- `help`: useful links pointing to documentation and/or guides.
