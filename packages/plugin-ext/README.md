<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - PLUGIN-EXT EXTENSION</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/plugin-ext` extension contributes functionality for the `plugin` API.

## Implementation

The implementation is inspired from: https://blog.mattbierner.com/vscode-webview-web-learnings/.

## Environment Variables

- `THEIA_WEBVIEW_ENDPOINT_PATTERN`

  A string pattern possibly containing `{{uuid}}` and `{{hostname}}` which will be replaced. This is the host for which the `webviews` will be served on.
  It is a good practice to host the `webview` handlers on a sub-domain as it is more secure.
  Defaults to `{{uuid}}.webview.{{hostname}}`.

## Security Warnings

- Potentially Insecure Host Pattern

  When you change the host pattern via the `THEIA_WEBVIEW_ENDPOINT_PATTERN` environment variable warning will be emitted both from the frontend and from the backend.
  You can disable those warnings by setting `warnOnPotentiallyInsecureHostPattern: false` in the appropriate application configurations in your application's `package.json`.

## Runtime System Plugin Resolvement

The backend application property `resolveSystemPlugins` is used to control the resolvement behavior for system plugins (builtins).
The property is used to control whether or not extension-packs and extension-dependencies are resolved at runtime.
