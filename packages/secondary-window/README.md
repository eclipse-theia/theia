<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - SECONDARY WINDOW EXTENSION</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/secondary-window` extension contributes the extract command and toolbar item to move extractable widgets to secondary windows.

To mark a widget to be extractable, implement the `ExtractableWidget` interface from `@theia/core`.

### Limitations

For the extraction to work we require changes in upstream libraries.
Theia offers the `theia-patch` CLI command to apply these patches.

Recommendation: Execute `theia-patch` in the `postinstall` script of your root npm package to automatically apply the patches.

If the patches are not applied, the secondary window will show empty.
