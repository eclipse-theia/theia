     *
     * A `WebviewPanelSerializer` is only required for the second case: persisting a webview across sessions.

     * and restore its content from this state when it becomes visible again. It is powered entirely
     * by the webview content itself. To save off a persisted state, call `acquireVsCodeApi().setState()` with
     * any json serializable object. To restore the state again, call `getState()`
     *
     * ```js
     * // Within the webview
     * const vscode = acquireVsCodeApi();
     *
     * // Get existing state
     * const oldState = vscode.getState() || { value: 0 };
     *
     * // Update state
     * setState({ value: oldState.value + 1 })
     * ```
     *
     * A `WebviewPanelSerializer` extends this persistence across restarts of Theia. When the editor is shutdown,
     * Theia will save off the state from `setState` of all webviews that have a serializer. When the
     * webview first becomes visible after the restart, this state is passed to `deserializeWebviewPanel`.
     * The extension can then restore the old `WebviewPanel` from this state.
