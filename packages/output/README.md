<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - OUTPUT EXTENSION</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/output` extension contributes an `output` widget to the application that displays output to end-users.
The displayed output usually comes from external commands executed by the backend, e.g. `git` or language-servers.
Generally, output requires a bit more of the user's attention compared to log messages as they tend to be more verbose,
and help identify internal operations which a user can act upon if problems occur.
