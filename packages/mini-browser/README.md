<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - MINI-BROWSER EXTENSION</h2>

<hr />

</div>

## Description

The `@theia/mini-browser` extension provides a browser widget with the corresponding backend endpoints.

## Environment Variables

- `THEIA_MINI_BROWSER_HOST_PATTERN`

  A string pattern possibly containing `{{uuid}}` and `{{hostname}}` which will be replaced. This is the host for which the `mini-browser` will serve.
  It is a good practice to host the `mini-browser` handlers on a sub-domain as it is more secure.
  Defaults to `{{uuid}}.mini-browser.{{hostname}}`.

## Security Warnings

- Potentially Insecure Host Pattern

  When you change the host pattern via the `THEIA_MINI_BROWSER_HOST_PATTERN` environment variable warnings will be emitted both from the frontend and from the backend.
  You can disable those warnings by setting `warnOnPotentiallyInsecureHostPattern: false` in the appropriate application configurations in your application's `package.json`.
