## Description

The `@theia/ai-core` extension serves as the basis of all AI integration in Theia.
It manages the integration of language models and provides core concepts like agents, prompts and AI variables.

Enablement of the Theia AI feature is managed via the AI preferences, contributed by `@theia/ai-core-ui`.
Either include `@theia/ai-core-ui` or bind the included preferences schemas in your Theia based application.
