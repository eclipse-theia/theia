<h2>ECLIPSE THEIA - GIT EXTENSION</h2>
<h2>This extension is DEPRECATED!</h2>
<h3>
It has a functional overlap with the VS Code built-in Git extension and it does not make sense to maintain our own Git extension anymore. This will reduce maintenance efforts.
If you are an active user of the Theia Git extension, we recommend you to evaluate switching to the VS Code built-in. If you see any issues with the switch, please raise them here.
</h3>
