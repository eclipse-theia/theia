# Uplift Journal: 23-32

Colin Grant hereinafter = 'I'
I'm creating this file to track thoughts, observations, and discoveries as I work through uplifting our Monaco dependency from 23 to 32 (current as of 2/7/2022).

## 2/7/2022

Today, my main goal is to figure out what obstacles are preventing us from consuming the published version of `monaco-editor-core` as ES modules rather than our home-cooked `@theia/monaco-editor-core` with module loading hijinks.

### Changes we make to Monaco

I looked over the commits that were added to the `theia-ide/vscode` repository as part of the last uplift relative to the VSCode repo using `git merge-base`. It looks like the changes were mainly of two kinds:
 - Most of the commits were tests of the NPM publishing system. They're not very interesting, but apparently they arrive at a functional GitHub task definition.
 - A [few changes](https://github.com/theia-ide/vscode/commit/ae832c2f8705d47596f9907828532d09354c8054) were made to include classes and interfaces that are not present in the normal `monaco-editor-core` build. It looks like Dan Arad did not include any commits that had been made to the theia-ide fork in previous work, but those may have been masked by the `git merge-base` command.

General impression is that we're really doing very little to Microsoft's code, at the moment.

### NaÃ¯vely plugging the public package into our repo

My next step was to see what would happen if we just replaced `@theia/monaco-editor-core` with `monaco-editor-core`. `yarn install` was no problem :-). And `monaco-editor-core` does come with an ESM-loadable file set. Great. But the 'official' API is exported via an `editor.api.d.ts` that is much better than our hand-written `monaco.d.ts` file, but does _not_ include anything other than the public API. That means that there are a lot of interfaces we're used to referring to (e.g. `ITextModelService`) that are not available to us. That should be remediable via a single TS flag...

#### Dev Env

Now I need to set up some stuff so that I can experiment with making changes to the VSCode repo and seeing their effect in Theia. I'll take some notes as I do that.

1. Have the VSCode repo on your system
2. Read the docs about how to build. The operative bit is is in `vscode/build/monaco/README.md` and the command is `yarn run gulp editor-distro`
3. In our docs there's mention of changing the treeshaking level. To do that, open `vscode/build/guplfile.editor.js` and find the `shakeLevel` setting. Set it to `0`. That should ensure that we don't accidentally end up referring to some class member that happens to have been optimized out.
4. Point your dependency at the local copy, e.g.

```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "monaco-editor-core": "file:...vscode/out-monaco-editor-core"
    }
}
```

You could probably symlink it and reduce the burden on your file system.

Getting VSCode to actually output the `.d.ts` files was a bit of a chore. The `vscode/build/lib/standalone.ts` has a line that sets the `declaration` compiler option to `false`. I wanted to make that `true`, so I changed the line in the TS file and tried to recompile and rebuild. No luck. Tried a few variants of that approach, all without success. Eventually I looked for the JS file that must be generated, and changed the code there. It would only show up in the file explorer when actually open, so somehow it's _super_ hidden. TODO: this shouldn't be that hard! Why were changes to the TS file not getting picked up?

With that change, the problems with importing types are gone. Huzzah. Probably the rest of the day will be eaten up finding all references to the global `monaco` object and replacing them with imports.

## 2/10/2022

After a couple of days of mechanical replacements, I moved onto substantive fixes yesterday. A few observations:

 - The way we've been consuming this code has made quite a muddle of things. Since _we_ wrote the `.d.ts` file, we could include private fields as public, write concrete returns for methods that are only guaranteed to return an interface, or add implementation details to interfaces where we knew what implementation we expect - and of course to mix references to API and non-API objects indiscriminately and without any indication of which is which. My principle in replacing the old system with the new has been to try to use the public API objects (`import * as Monaco from 'monaco-editor-core';`) where possible and fall back to private objects where necessary. There are still a lot of references to private API, and that has consequences for some areas of the code:
    - In non-API code, VSCode uses `const enums` and translates them to non-`const enums` in the API. As a consequence, API and non-API interfaces and classes that refer to those enums are considered incomparable by TypeScript (requires `as unknown as X`').
    - In non-API code, VSCode inlcudes `/** @internal */` JSDocs in interfaces to remove fields from the public interface. As a consequence, public API interfaces often can't satisfy the equivalent non-API interfaces.
 - There are a number of places where it looks like we may have added fixes for problems that have fixed in VSCode in the meantime. I noticed this in the implementation of the `DiffNavigator`, where we were digging into private fields to do work that was already being done in the VSCode implementation. There are probably a lot of cases like that, and I'm not going to try to to catch them in this first round. It's a lot easier to find, now, though, since we can go look at the code.

More private API munging. It's notable how inconsistent our use of Monaco is. In some cases, we delegate to its services, in some cases, we override them, and in others, we reimplement them, without obvious rhyme or reason in the decision. Not much to do about it in this pass, but it's worth considering.

## 2/16/2022

Eventually eliminated all references to the old global `monaco` object and aligned type signatures sufficiently that the application builds and runs. A few notes on that:

 - Plugin-side code was referring to the `monaco` namespace but doesn't include it when built. I referred to our `types-impl` code instead, but that's a bit of a fudge.
 - The quick pick code was a bit tricky to type correctly. Basically, VSCode splits the separators and the items, and then creates a union type to cover both. We were using a single type. I refactored to mirror the VSCode pattern, and things compile now, but it's probably worth circling back to check on whether those types have been handled as elegantly as they should be.
 - Part of the inelegance in the match between our quick input interfaces and the implementations was in the typing of events. We refer to our `Event` type, but Monaco usually exposes `IEvent` which lacks a (listed) public `maxListeners` field. In general, we're a lot more dependent on implementations than VSCode.

To do:

 - [x] Editor context menu styling broken
 - [x] Quick pick styling broken
    > Looks like the problem is not in the styling: the selector is still present. It looks like theme details are not being loaded into the stylesheet.
    > 100% my fault, returning null instead of a string color value.
 - [x] Commands palette pretty broken.
    > - ctrl+shift+p brings up the command palette.
    > - ctrl+p + '>' does not bring up command list.
    > - ctrl+shift+p + search term -> always empty.  
    > We needed to clear the Monaco registry to allow our `QuickCommandService` to win out over one registered by Monaco at import time.
 - [x] Commands not getting added to editor context menu
    > Had to do with initialization. A thorny issue. Previous Monaco allowed users to pass in overrides any time they constructed an editor. New Monaco only applies the overrides _the first time_ an editor is constructed.
 - [] Colorization not working for any language with an editor open _on start_.
    > Got confusing results here. Colorization seems to be failing at a check whether the model has any associated editors. But it really looks like its editor count is being incremented, and the same thing doesn't seem to be interfering with other language colorizations. PS: although the colors were working yesterady for languages other than TS, they are not working today. 
    > This also seems to have been a problem with color registrations, and appears to be working now.
    > Agh! Nevermind, suddenly it's back to TS not working, everything else working.
    > Nevermind that, too. Seems that any language that's open in an editor _on start_ won't work during that session. But anything in a language that wasn't open on start is fine.
 - [] Add new editor preferences.
 - [] There's a context-menu command to open the command palette. In VSCode, that opens in the same place as the keyboard shortcut, but in Theia it's opening inside the editor.
 - [] Editor context menu 'goto' commands not working (no peek editor shown).
