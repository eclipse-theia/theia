<a name="breaking_changes_1.62.0">[Breaking Changes:](#breaking_changes_1.62.0)</a>

- [core] refactored menu nodes [#14676](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/14676) - Contributed on behalf of STMicroelectronics
- [ai-core] refactored prompt management and the agent registration interface [#15632](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/15632)\
  Check the PR for more information.
- [ai-history]  updated logic to use communication model in AI history [#15540](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/15540) - Contributed by STMicroelectronics\
  This refactoring removes the communication recording service. Manual recording is no longer needed. When using the `LanguageModelService`, LLM interactions are automatically recorded into a communication model, which can be inspected in the history view.
- [monaco] implemented "code actions on save" [#15555](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/15555) - Contributed on behalf of STMicroelectronics\
  Replaced `MonacoEditorModel.onWillSave` "wait until event" event with `registerWillSaveModelListener` for simpler semantics. Also removed the `EditorModelService.onWillSave`
  as it's pure convenience and unused in framework code.
