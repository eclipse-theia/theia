<a name="1_5_0_electron_main_extension"></a>
- [[electron]](#1_5_0_electron_main_extension) Electron applications can now be configured/extended through `inversify`. Added new `electronMain` extension points to provide inversify container modules. [#8076](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8076)

<a name="breaking_changes_1.5.0">[Breaking Changes:](#breaking_changes_1.5.0)</a>

- [core] removed `KeybindingRegistry#getScopedKeybindingsForCommand` [#8283](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8283)
- [application-package] removed `isOutdated` from `ExtensionPackage` [#8295](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8295)
- [application-package] removed `getLatestVersion` from `ExtensionPackage` [#8295](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8295)
- [application-package] removed `getVersionRange` from `ExtensionPackage` [#8295](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8295)
- [application-package] removed `resolveVersionRange` from `ExtensionPackage` [#8295](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8295)
- [output] `OutputWidget#setInput` has been removed. The _Output_ view automatically shows the channel when calling `OutputChannel#show`. Moved the `OutputCommands` namespace from the `output-contribution` to its dedicated `output-commands` module to overcome a DI cycle. [#8243](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8243)
- [example-app] updated `yarn.lock` so that the latest version of `vscode-ripgrep` is used (`v1.8.0`). This way we can benefit from the recently added support for it using proxy settings when fetching the platform-specific `ripgrep` executable, after npm package install. This should make it a lot easier to build our example application in corporate settings, behind a firewall. [#8280](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8280)
  - Note to downstream IDE designers: this change will not have an effect beyond the example application of the repository. If it's desirable for your product to have the latest `vscode-ripgrep`, you should do similarly in your own `yarn.lock`.
<a name="1.5.0_deprecate_file_system"></a>
- [[filesystem]](#1.5.0_deprecate_file_system) `FileSystem` and `FileSystemWatcher` services are deprecated [#7908](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/7908)
  - On the backend there is no more `FileSystem` implementation. One has to use Node.js APIs instead.
  - On the frontend, the `FileService` should be used instead. It was ported from VS Code for compatibility with VS Code extensions.
  - On the frontend, the `EnvVariableServer` should be used instead to access the current user home and available drives.
<a name="1.5.0_userstorage_as_fs_provider"></a>
- [[userstorage]](#1.5.0_userstorage_as_fs_provider) `UserStorageService` was replaced by the user data fs provider [#7908](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/7908)
<a name="1.5.0_webview_resource_streaming"></a>
- [[webview]](#1.5.0_webview_resource_streaming) webview resources are streamed instead of loading one by one the entire content and blocking the web socket [#8359](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8359)
  - Consequently, `WebviewResourceLoader` is removed. One should change `DiskFileSystemProvider` to customize resource loading instead.
<a name="1.5.0_root_user_storage_uri"></a>
- [[user-storage]](#1.5.0_root_user_storage_uri) settings URI must start with `/user` root to satisfy expectations of `FileService` [#8313](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8313)
  - If you implement a custom user storage make sure to check old relative locations, otherwise it can cause user data loss.
<a name="1_5_0_electron_window_options_ipc"></a>
- [[electron]](#1_5_0_electron_window_options_ipc) Removed the `set-window-options` and `get-persisted-window-options-additions` Electron IPC handlers from the Electron Main process.
<a name="1.5.0_non_blocking_bulk_edit"></a>
- [[monaco]](#1.5.0_non_blocking_bulk_edit) `MonacoWorkspace.applyBulkEdit` does not open any editors anymore to avoid blocking [#8329](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8329)
  - Consequently, it does not accept editor opener options, and `MonacoWorkspace.openEditors` and `MonacoWorkspace.toTextEditWithEditor` are removed.
<a name="1.5.0_declarative_default_themes"></a>
- [[theming]](#1.5.0_declarative_default_themes) Default color and icon themes should be declared in the application `package.json`. [#8381](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8381)

  ```json
  "theia": {
    "frontend": {
      "config": {
        "defaultTheme": "light",
        "defaultIconTheme": "vs-seti"
      }
    }
  },
  ```
  - Consequently, `ThemeService` and `IconThemeService` don't allow to change the default color or icon theme anymore.
<a name="1_5_0_drop_node_10_support"></a>
- [[repo]](#1_5_0_drop_node_10_support) support for `Node 10` is dropped. [#8290](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/8290)
  - From now on, Node.js `12.x` is required when building.\
   The recommended minimum version is aligned with `electron` (Node.js `12.14.1`).

## v1.4.0 - 30/07/2020

The default location remains the same: `~/.theia`, however it can be customized by overriding the `#getConfigDirUri` method of the `EnvVariablesServer` API. The easiest way is to subclass the `EnvVariablesServerImpl` and rebind it in your backend module:
  ```ts
  // your-env-variables-server.ts:

  import { injectable } from 'inversify';
  import { EnvVariablesServerImpl } from '@theia/core/lib/node/env-variables';

  @injectable()
  export class YourEnvVariableServer extends EnvVariablesServerImpl {

      async getConfigDirUri(): Promise<string> {
          return 'file:///path/to/your/desired/config/dir';
      }

  }

  // your-backend-application-module.ts:

  import { ContainerModule } from 'inversify';
  import { EnvVariablesServer } from '@theia/core/lib/common/env-variables';
  import { YourEnvVariableServer } from './your-env-variables-server';

  export default new ContainerModule((bind, unbind, isBound, rebind) => {
      rebind(EnvVariablesServer).to(YourEnvVariableServer).inSingletonScope();
  });
  ```

- Support VS Code icon and color theming. [#6475](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/6475)
  - Theming: Before `input`, `textarea`, `select` and `button` elements were styled in an ad-hoc manner, i.e.
  some were styled globally for a tag, other per a component and third with a dedicated css class name.
  Now Theia does not style these elements by default, but an extension developer should decide.
  Theia comes though with predefined css class names: `theia-input`, `theia-select` and `theia-button`
  to style input/textarea, select and button elements correspondingly. Existing components were refactored to use them.
  - Theming: Theia css colors are replaced with [VS Code colors](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/theme-color).
    - One can reference VS Code color in css by prefixing them with `--theia` and replacing all dots with dashes.
    For example `widget.shadow` color can be referenced in css with `var(--theia-widget-shadow)`.
    - One can resolve a current color value programmatically with `ColorRegistry.getCurrentColor`.
    - One can load a new color theme:
      - in the frontend module to enable it on startup

        ```ts
            MonacoThemingService.register({
                id: 'myDarkTheme',
                label: 'My Dark Theme',
                uiTheme: 'vs-dark',
                json: require('./relative/path/to/my_theme.json'),
                includes: {
                    './included_theme.json': require('./relative/path/to/included_theme.json')
                }
            });
        ```

      - later from a file:

        ```ts
            @inject(MonacoThemingService)
            protected readonly monacoThemeService: MonacoThemingService;

            this.monacoThemeService.register({
                id: 'myDarkTheme',
                label: 'My Dark Theme',
                uiTheme: 'vs-dark',
                uri: 'file:///absolute/path/to/my_theme.json'
            });
        ```

      - or install from a VS Code extension.
    - One should not introduce css color variables anymore or hardcode colors in css.
    - One can contribute new colors by implementing `ColorContribution` contribution point and calling `ColorRegistry.register`.
    It's important that new colors are derived from existing VS Code colors if one plans to allow installation of VS Code extension contributing color themes.
    Otherwise, there is no guarantee that new colors don't look alien for a random VS Code color theme.
    One can derive from an existing color, just by plainly referencing it, e.g. `dark: 'widget.shadow'`,
    or applying transformations, e.g. `dark: Color.lighten('widget.shadow', 0.4)`.
    - One can though specify values, without deriving from VS Code colors, for new colors in their own theme.
    See for example, how [Light (Theia)](packages/monaco/data/monaco-themes/vscode/light_theia.json) theme overrides colors for the activity bar.
  - Labeling: `LabelProvider.getIcon` should be sync and fast to avoid blocking rendering and icon caching.
  One has to pass more specific elements to get a more specific icon. For example, one cannot answer precisely from a URI
  whether a folder or a file icon should be used. If a client wants to get a proper result then it should pass `FileStat` for example or
  provide own `LabelProviderContribution` which derives `FileStat` from a custom data structure and then calls  `LabelProvider.getIcon` again.
  - Labeling: `LabelProviderContribution` methods can return `undefined` meaning that the next contribution should be tried.
  - Tree: `TreeNode.name`, `TreeNode.description` and `TreeNode.icon` are deprecated and will be removed later.
  One has to provide `LabelProviderContribution` implementation for a custom tree node structure.
  Before these attributes have to be computed for all nodes and stored as a part of the layout.
  From now on they will be computed only on demand for visible nodes.
  It decreases requirements to the local storage and allows to invalidate node appearance by simply re-rendering a tree.
- Updated `example-browser` and `example-electron` applications to remove extensions which are instead contributed by VS Code builtin extensions [#6883](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/6883)
  - Extensions removed from the example applications are deprecated and will be removed in the future. If adopters/extenders would like to continue
  using the deprecated extensions, they must be self-maintained and can be accessed through the repository's Git history.
  - In order to fetch plugins remotely, the `@theia/cli` script `download:plugins` can be used:
    - In your `package.json` you can define:
      - `theiaPluginDir`: to specify the folder in which to download plugins, in respect to your `package.json`
      - `theiaPlugins`: to specify the list of plugins in the form of `"id": "url"`

Breaking changes:
- [core] renamed preference `list.openMode` to `workbench.list.openMode` [#6481](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/6481)
- [monaco] removed monaco prefix from commands [#5590](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/5590)
- [plugin] re-implemented webviews to align with [VS Code browser implementation](https://blog.mattbierner.com/vscode-webview-web-learnings/) [#6465](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/6465)
  - Security: `vscode.previewHTML` is removed, see https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_33#_removing-the-vscodepreviewhtml-command
  - Security: Before all webviews were deployed on [the same origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)
  allowing them to break out and manipulate shared data as cookies, local storage or even start service workers
  for the main window as well as for each other. Now each webview will be deployed on own origin by default.
    - Webview origin pattern can be configured with `THEIA_WEBVIEW_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT` env variable. The default value is `{{uuid}}.webview.{{hostname}}`.
  Here `{{uuid}}` and `{{hostname}}` are placeholders which get replaced at runtime with proper webview uuid
  and [hostname](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils/hostname) correspondingly.
    - To switch to un-secure mode as before configure `THEIA_WEBVIEW_EXTERNAL_ENDPOINT` with `{{hostname}}` as a value.
    You can also drop `{{uuid}}.` prefix, in this case, webviews still will be able to access each other but not the main window.
  - Remote: Local URIs are resolved by default to the host serving Theia.
  If you want to resolve to another host or change how remote URIs are constructed then
  implement [ExternalUriService.resolve](./packages/core/src/browser/external-uri-service.ts) in a frontend module.
  - Content loading: Webview HTTP endpoint is removed. Content loaded via [WebviewResourceLoader](./packages/plugin-ext/src/main/common/webview-protocol.ts) JSON-RPC service
  with properly preserved resource URIs. Content is only loaded if it's allowed by WebviewOptions.localResourceRoots, otherwise, the service won't be called.
  If you want to customize content loading then implement [WebviewResourceLoaderImpl](packages/plugin-ext/src/main/node/webview-resource-loader-impl.ts) in a backend module.
  - Theming: Theia styles are not applied to webviews anymore
   instead [VS Code way of styling](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/webview#theming-webview-content) should be used.
   VS Code color variables also available with `--theia` prefix.
  - Testing: Webview can work only in secure context because they rely on service workers to load local content and redirect local to remote requests.
  Most browsers define a page as served from secure context if its url has `https` scheme. For local testing `localhost` is treated as a secure context as well.
  Unfortunately, it does not work nicely in FireFox, since it does not treat subdomains of localhost as secure as well, compare to Chrome.
  If you want to test with FireFox you can configure it as described [here](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/6465#issuecomment-556443218).

    - use `PluginReader.readDependencies` to load dependencies
  - `PluginMetadata` does not have anymore raw package.json model to avoid sending excessive data to the frontend
    - `theia.Plugin.packageJSON` throws an unsupported error for frontend plugins as a consequence. Please convert to a backend plugin if you need access to it
  - `PluginManagerExt.$init` does not start plugins anymore, but only initialize the manager RPC services to avoid sending excessive initialization data, as all preferences, on each deployment
    - please call `$start` to start plugins
  - `PluginDeployerHandler.getPluginMetadata` is replaced with `PluginDeployerHandler.getPluginDependencies` to access plugin dependencies

  - `HostedPluginReader.doGetPluginMetadata` is renamed to `HostedPluginReader.getPluginMetadata`
  - `PluginDebugAdapterContribution.languages`, `PluginDebugAdapterContribution.getSchemaAttributes` and `PluginDebugAdapterContribution.getConfigurationSnippets` are removed to prevent sending the contributions second time to the frontend. Debug contributions are loaded statically from the deployed plugin metadata instead. The same for corresponding methods in `DebugExtImpl`
- [task] removed `watchedConfigFileUris`, `watchersMap` `watcherServer`, `fileSystem`, `configFileUris`, `watchConfigurationFile()` and `unwatchConfigurationFile()` from `TaskConfigurations` class [6268](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/6268)
