<a name="breaking_changes_1.67.0">[Breaking Changes:](#breaking_changes_1.67.0)</a>

- [ai-core] objects returned by `AiSettingsService` settings retrievals marked readonly. To mutate a settings object, make a copy. [#16612](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16612)
- [core] `CommonCommands` has been extracted from `common-frontend-contribution.ts` into its own file `common-commands.ts`. This only affects code using deep imports: imports of `CommonCommands` from `@theia/core/lib/browser/common-frontend-contribution` should be updated to use the standard barrel export `@theia/core/lib/browser` instead.
- [core] `CommonMenus` has been extracted from `common-frontend-contribution.ts` into its own file `common-menus.ts`. This only affects code using deep imports: imports of `CommonMenus` from `@theia/core/lib/browser/common-frontend-contribution` should be updated to use the standard barrel export `@theia/core/lib/browser` instead.
- [core] moved CommonCommands to separate file [#16522](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16522)
- [debug] `DebugSessionManager.getFunctionBreakpoints()`, `DebugSessionManager.getInstructionBreakpoints()`, and `DebugSessionManager.getBreakpoints()` no longer default to the current session when called without arguments. Callers that relied on the implicit default to `currentSession` must now pass `this.currentSession` explicitly. [#16537](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16537)
- [debug] refactored some of the debug model elements as part of [#16689](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16689):
  - added required `id` parameter to `DebugStackFrame` and `DebugScope` constructors
  - changed type of keys in the `DebugThread._frames` map from `number` to `string`
  - added required `startFrame` parameter to `DebugThread.doUpdateFrames` method
- [debug] some of the fields and methods of `DebugToolBar` have been removed in [#16719](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16719)

- [plugin-ext] `$setBadge` method removed from `WebviewsMain` interface and `WebviewsMainImpl`; badge-related fields removed from `WebviewView` interface and implementation; badge-related fields removed from `PluginViewWidget`; badge-related fields removed from `WebviewWidget`. Use the `BadgeService` instead of `BadgeWidget` interface implementation to show extension badges. [#16518](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16518)
- [scm] `ScmTabBarDecorator` and bindings removed. `ScmWidget` now contributes badge decorations via the `BadgeService`. [#16518](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/16518)

<a name="breaking_changes_1.62.0">[Breaking Changes:](#breaking_changes_1.62.0)</a>

- [core] refactored menu nodes [#14676](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/14676) - Contributed on behalf of STMicroelectronics
- [ai-core] refactored prompt management and the agent registration interface [#15632](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/15632)\
  Check the PR for more information.
- [ai-history]  updated logic to use communication model in AI history [#15540](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/15540) - Contributed by STMicroelectronics\
  This refactoring removes the communication recording service. Manual recording is no longer needed. When using the `LanguageModelService`, LLM interactions are automatically recorded into a communication model, which can be inspected in the history view.
- [monaco] implemented "code actions on save" [#15555](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/15555) - Contributed on behalf of STMicroelectronics\
  Replaced `MonacoEditorModel.onWillSave` "wait until event" event with `registerWillSaveModelListener` for simpler semantics. Also removed the `EditorModelService.onWillSave`
  as it's pure convenience and unused in framework code.
