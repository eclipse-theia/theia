<a name="breaking_changes_1.24.0">[Breaking Changes:](#breaking_changes_1.24.0)</a>

- [core] removed method `attachGlobalShortcuts` from `ElectronMainApplication`. Attaching shortcuts in that way interfered with internal shortcuts. Use internal keybindings instead of global shortcuts [#10869](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10869)
- [debug] the getter `model` was renamed to `getModel` and accepts an optional `URI` parameter [#10875](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10875)
- [debug] The interface method `DebugService#provideDynamicDebugConfigurations` changes the return type to  `Record<string, DebugConfiguration[]>` [#10910](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10910)
  This impacts the corresponding return type for `DebugConfigurationManager#provideDynamicDebugConfigurations`.
  The following functions under `plugin-api-rpc.ts#DebugExt` and in the `PluginDebugAdapterContribution` are deprecated
    * $provideDebugConfigurations
    * $resolveDebugConfigurations
    * $resolveDebugConfigurationWithSubstitutedVariablesByHandle
    The `PluginDebugAdapterContributionRegistrator` interface has been removed
- [filesystem] The `generateUniqueResourceURI` method from the `FileSystemUtils` class has an updated signature. Additionally, the method now returns a generated Uri that uses spaces as separators. The naming scheme was also changed to match VSCode. [10767](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10767)
- [markers] `ProblemDecorator` reimplemented to reduce redundancy and align more closely with VSCode. `collectMarkers` now returns `Map<string, TreeDecoration.Data>`, `getOverlayIconColor` renamed to `getColor`, `getOverlayIcon` removed, `appendContainerMarkers` returns `void` [#10820](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10820)
- [monaco] the following breaking changes were made in the Monaco uplift. [#10736](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10736)
  - `QuickPickItem` is now only for selectable items. Use `QuickPickItemOrSeparator` when either an item or a separator is intended.
  - `editor.autoSave` preference renamed `files.autoSave` and accepts `off`, `afterDelay`, `onFocusChange`, `onWindowChange`. Use `!== 'off'` to check for any active state, as `on` is no longer a valid value.
  - `editor.autoSaveDelay` renamed `files.autoSaveDelay`.
  - `commandService`, `instantiationService` removed from `MonacoEditor`. Use `StandaloneServices.get(IInstantationService / ICommandService)` instead.
  - `DecorationMiniMapOptions.position`, `DecorationOverviewRulerOptions.position` no longer optional.
  - Overrides used by `MonacoEditorFactory` accept the type `EditorServiceOverrides` rather than `{[key: string]: any}`.
- [workspace] removed unused injections in `WorkspaceService`: `ApplicationShell`, `StorageService`, `LabelProvider`, `SelectionService`, `CommandRegistry`, `WorkspaceCommandContribution`. [#10868](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10868)

- [plugin] the constructor of `BackendApplication` class no longer invokes the `initialize` method. Instead, the `@postConstruct configure` method now starts by calling `initialize` [#10407](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10407)
- In order to cleanup the code base, the constructor signature of the following classes got changed in an API-breaking way [#10737](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia/pull/10737):
  - `ProblemWidget`
  - `FileNavigatorWidget`
  - `TerminalServer`
  - `TimelineTreeWidget`
