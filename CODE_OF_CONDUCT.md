# Community Code of Conduct
Version 1.0
June 23, 2015

As members of the Eclipse community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting code reviews, pull requests, patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in the Eclipse community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion or analogous grounds.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Eclipse Foundation staff have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project leaders, committers and contributors who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project.

This code of conduct applies within Eclipse project spaces, or in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or the Eclipse community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by emailing the Eclipse Management Organization: codeofconduct@eclipse.org.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant (http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.1.0, available at http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/
