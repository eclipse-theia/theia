# Getting Started

The fastest way to getting started is to clone the [theia-playwright-template](https://github.com/eclipse-theia/theia-playwright-template) and build the theia-playwright-template.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eclipse-theia/theia-playwright-template.git
cd theia-playwright-template
yarn
```

The most important files in the theia-playwright-template are:

* Example test in `tests/theia-app.test.ts`
* Example page object in `test/page-objects/theia-app.ts`
* Configuration files in `configs`, including the base playwright configuration at `configs/playwright.config.ts`
* `package.json` with all required dependencies and scripts for running and debugging the tests

Now, let's run the tests:

1. Run your Theia application under test (not part of the theia-playwright-template)
2. Run `yarn ui-tests` in the theia-playwright-template to run its tests in headless mode

Please note that Theia ðŸŽ­ Playwright is built to be extended with custom page objects, such as the one in `test/page-objects/theia-app.ts` in the theia-playwright-template.
We recommend to add further page objects for all custom views, editors, widgets, etc.
Please refer to the [extension guide](EXTENSIBILITY.md) for more information.

Moreover, this repository contains several tests based on Theia ðŸŽ­ Playwright in `examples/playwright/src/tests` that may serve as additional examples for writing tests.

## Adding further tests

Let's write another system test for the Theia text editor as an example:

1. Initialize a prepared workspace containing a file `sampleFolder/sample.txt` and open the workspace with the Theia application under test
2. Open the Theia text editor
3. Replace the contents of line 1 with `change` and check the line contents and the dirty state, which now should indicate that the editor is dirty.
4. Perform an undo twice and verify that the line contents should be what it was before the change. The dirty state should be clean again.
5. Run redo twice and check that line 1 shows the text `change` again. Also the dirty state should be changed again.
6. Save the editor with the saved contents and check whether the editor state is clean after save. Close the editor.
7. Reopen the same file and check whether the contents of line 1 shows still the changed contents.

The test code could look as follows. We use the page objects `TheiaWorkspace` and `TheiaApp` to initialize the application with a prepared workspace.
Using the `TheiaApp` instance, we open an editor of type `TheiaTextEditor`, which allows us to exercise actions, such as replacing line contents, undo, redo, etc.
At any time, we can also get information from the text editor, such as obtaining dirty state and verify whether this information is what we expect.

```typescript
test("should undo and redo text changes and correctly update the dirty state", async () => {
    // 1. set up workspace contents and open Theia app
    const ws = new TheiaWorkspace(["src/tests/resources/sample-files1"]);
    const app = await TheiaApp.load(page, ws);

    // 2. open Theia text editor
    const sampleTextEditor = await app.openEditor(
        "sample.txt",
        TheiaTextEditor
    );

    // 3. make a change and verify contents and dirty
    await sampleTextEditor.replaceLineWithLineNumber("change", 1);
    expect(await sampleTextEditor.textContentOfLineByLineNumber(1)).toBe(
        "change"
    );
    expect(await sampleTextEditor.isDirty()).toBe(true);

    // 4. undo and verify contents and dirty state
    await sampleTextEditor.undo(2);
    expect(await sampleTextEditor.textContentOfLineByLineNumber(1)).toBe(
        "this is just a sample file"
    );
    expect(await sampleTextEditor.isDirty()).toBe(false);

    // 5. undo and verify contents and dirty state
    await sampleTextEditor.redo(2);
    expect(await sampleTextEditor.textContentOfLineByLineNumber(1)).toBe(
        "change"
    );
    expect(await sampleTextEditor.isDirty()).toBe(true);

    // 6. save verify dirty state
    await sampleTextEditor.save();
    expect(await sampleTextEditor.isDirty()).toBe(false);
    await sampleTextEditor.close();

    // 7. reopen editor and verify dirty state
    const reopenedEditor = await app.openEditor("sample.txt", TheiaTextEditor);
    expect(await reopenedEditor.textContentOfLineByLineNumber(1)).toBe(
        "change"
    );

    await reopenedEditor.close();
});
```

Below you can see this example test in action by stepping through the code with the VSCode debug tools.

## Best practices

The playwright tests/functions are all asynchronous so the `await` keyword should be used to wait for the result of a given function.
This way there is no need to use timeouts or other functions to wait for a specific result.
As long as await is used on any call, the tests should be in the intended state.

There are two ways to query the page for elements using a selector.

1. One is the `page.$(selector)` method, which returns null or the element, if it is available.
2. The other method `page.waitForSelector(selector)`, like indicated by the name, waits until the selector becomes available. This ensures that the element could be loaded and therefore negates the
   need for null checks afterwards.

Avoid directly interacting with the document object model, such as HTML elements, or the Playwright `page` from tests directly.
The interaction with the application should be encapsulated in the page objects.
Otherwise, your tests will get bloated and more fragile to changes of the application.
For more information, refer to the [page object pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html).

Avoid returning or exposing Playwright types from page objects.
This keeps your tests independent of the underlying browser automation framework.

## Executing tests

Before running your tests, the Theia application under test needs to be running.
This repository already provides an example Theia application, however, you might want to test your custom Theia-based application instead.

To run the application provided in this repository, run `yarn browser start` in the root of this repository after building everything with `yarn`.
You may also use the `Launch Browser Backend` launch configuration in VS Code.

### Running the tests headless

To start the tests run `yarn ui-tests` in the folder `playwright`.
This will start the tests in a headless state.

To only run a single test file, the path of a test file can be set with `yarn ui-tests <path-to-file>` or `yarn ui-tests -g "<partial test file name>"`.
See the [Playwright Test command line documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#command-line).

### Running the tests headfull

If you want to observe the execution of the tests in a browser, use `yarn ui-tests-headful` for all tests or `yarn ui-tests-headful <path-to-file>` to only run a specific test.

### Debugging the tests

To debug a test, open the test file in the code editor and run the `Run Playwright Test` configuration inside VS Code.
This will start the Playwright inspector and debug the currently opened test file.
Using this approach, you will be able to observe the tests in the browser and set breakpoints in VSCode.

_Note that the tests need to be started in the playwright inspector again, as playwright pauses once the test reaches the `page.goto()` call._

The Playwright inspector contains an editor that shows the currently executed code and offers debugging capabilities, which can be used instead of attaching the VS code debugger.

The launched browser instance contains some additional features that are useful to debugging playwright tests. The browsers console contains a playwright object, which can be used to test the playwright API.
For example the result of a given selector can be inspected. Additionally, this browser instance offers some quality of life improvements, such as preventing to resize the web application when the developer tools are opened, etc.

For more information on debugging, please refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug).

## Advanced Topics

There are many more features, configuration and command line options from Playwright that can be used.
These range from grouping and annotating tests, further reporters, to visual comparisons, etc.
For more information refer to the [Playwright documentation](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro).
